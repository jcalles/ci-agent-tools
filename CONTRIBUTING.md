# Contributing Guide

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this documentation: [Making a Pull Request](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request)

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Commit you changes to your own fork
3. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

- Explain what the PR fixes or improves.
- Try to make it as small and self-explanatory as you can.
- Use a sensible number of commit messages as well
  - e.g. Your PR should not have 10s of commits

4. Wait for the reviews and feedback from maintainers

## Things to keep in mind

- Smaller Pull Requests are likely to be merged more quickly than bigger changes
- Try to keep your commit messages as simple and direct as you can.
- Use self explanatory commit messages
  - If you have any doubt, check previous messages before commiting (e.g. `git log`)
- If your changes are related to a specific story in your team, you can include your story number in the commit message and PR name:
  > STORY-1234 [Name Lastname] Adding a new feature to your awesome project
